            In the decentralized era, using Blockchain technology, networks are
            turned into open and meritocratic markets. Bitcoin was the first
            Blockchain, with the primary use case being peerto-peer transport
            of digital currency. This represented the proof of concept. Under
            Blockchain technology, centralized proprietary services are being
            replaced with distributed and decentralized open ones; trusted
            entities replaced with verifiable computation; brittle location
            addresses replaced with resilient content addresses; inefficient
            monolithic services replaced with peer-to-peer algorithmic markets.

            completely open and anyone can join and participate in the network. The 
            network typically has an incentivizing mechanism to encourage more

            a network must solve a complex, resource-intensive cryptographic problem
