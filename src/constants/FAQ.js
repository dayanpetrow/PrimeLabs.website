        panelContent: ` One of the biggest advantages of blockchain systems, versus conventional alternatives, 
        is that all of the information stored on these networks are encrypted and secured. In other words, the 
        data is far less prone to the growing threat of a cyber-attack. Furthermore, the physical storage of the 
        data is decentralized, meaning there is no single point of entrance for a wide-scale attack.
        Distributed systems of record also have a number of advantages over typical options. Rather than store 
        everything in a centralized location, which is vulnerable to hacking, these blockchain networks rely on 
        cryptographic algorithms to authorize access to information. These networks operate without human 
        intervention or handling. Less human input reduces the margin of error and manipulation, restoring 
        power back to the individuals in the network.`

        panelTitle: "Real estate",
        panelContent: `Though the residential and commercial real estate sector is responsible for a significant portion of 
        the modern economy, it is still fraught with inefficiencies. The space is heavily reliant on paper-based 
        manual processes, and is subject to both fraud and corruption. Plagued by brokerage services and regulations, 
        the real estate industry needs more transparency and liquidity. Luckily, startups have found ways to leverage 
        blockchains in order to bridge the gap between digital ownership and real world assets. Their platform enables
        real estate owners (timeshare, rentals, homes, etc.) to issue tokens for each property, so that those properties 
        can be easily traded on a globally liquid exchange. It’s akin to being able to “IPO” individual properties. 
        Real properties, and baskets of properties, can then be traded globally the way Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
         are traded today. The tokenization of real estate will eliminate the threat of fraud, currently present in the 
         real estate community, and align incentives among buyers, sellers, brokers, and renters.`

        panelContent: `As we witnessed in 2016’s US presidential election, the threat of mass voter-fraud is alive and 
        growing. While this was not the first time a party was accused of rigging an election, it certainly brought 
        attention to and called into question the legitimacy of the democracy. In many ways, it also highlighted the 
        number of error-prone processes and misaligned incentives that exist throughout the government. Within the 
        next 20 years, it is likely that we will see a major transition from paper- based systems to entirely digital 
        voting. During that shift, we can begin to leverage the power of trustless blockchain technology to serve as 
        the permission- holder of the voting system..`

        panelContent: ` Supply chains are the backbone of our modern, international economy. The billion-dollar 
        problem, however, is that they are largely built on top of legacy architecture that relies on manual 
        processes. As a result, in any given supply chain, there are often dozens of intermediary third-parties 
        that increase friction and decrease ownership throughout the lifecycle. This not only dramatically raises 
        cost, but also carries plenty of industry- specific, auxiliary effects that slow down momentum throughout 
        the funnel. Thus, there is a massive opportunity in applying blockchains as a means of automating past the 
        various inefficient processes that currently exist across the world’s most complicated industries 
        (shipping, oil, healthcare). From labor to transaction to waste costs, all of the data generated in 
        any given supply chain can be automatically logged in a blockchain ledger.`

        Though unpredictable in nature, cryptocurrencies are perhaps the most widely popularized and highly anticipated application of blockchain technology. Optimistic technologists predict that cryptocurrencies, and digital assets broadly, will entirely replace fiat systems of finance within the next decade. Cryptocurrencies can be used to enable an entire generation of people who currently lack access to basic financial services like banking and investing. This is a fundamental shift toward a globalized economy that will be accessible to anyone with stable internet, thereby empowering the next generation of entrepreneurs and professionals.

        Blockchain technology can revamp the trust by securely storing medical records that can be accurately and safely transferred to and accessed by the doctors and people who are authorized. Blockchain will aid in the authorization and identification of people. In fact, startups are already working to make positive, multi-source identification a reality across all industries using the blockchain technology.

        These apps run on a custom built blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property.
        
        This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middleman or counterparty risk.

        NEO is a blockchain platform and cryptocurrency designed to build a scalable network of decentralized applications. The base asset of the NEO blockchain is the non divisible NEO token which generates GAS tokens that can be used to pay for transaction fees generated by applications on the network. NEO supports a wide variety of commonly used programming languages such as Javascript and C++ by using a customized version of Docker called neoVM that compiles the code into a secure executable environment.
        
        NEO uses a delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) consensus mechanism and can support up to 10,000 transactions per second. To achieve consensus, book keeping nodes are randomly selected to validate transactions on the network based overlapping networks.
