            Connector (EC) is Lykke's dedicated service for managing connectivity with other 
            crypto exchanges. EC feeds order books, ticks and order updates from exchanges such 
            as Lykke, Bitfinex, GDAX, Cex.IO and others. The main functionality allows subscribing 
            to orderbook updates, tick updates and order execution events and stores the data 
            locally in Lykkeâ€™s database. Along with that, data gets published into an internal 
            Lykke queue, where it is made available to other services, systems and modules. It 
            can be used for real-time and historical data testing, statistics, analysis and for 
            any other liquidity demanding purposes.

                The Exchange Connector was a single point for connecting to all external exchanges 
                and thus was a potential point of failure that could lead to a lot of data loss. 
                Increased resource usage and slow data processing were also possible. Thus we needed 
                to refactor it and introduce a new design complying with the increasing demands for 
                performance, flexibility, maintainability and availability.

            <FluidParagraph>
                The proposed solution introduced a microservice architecture and separated each exchange 
                into its own dedicated service. Each service was optimized and dedicated to delivering 
                data from a specific exchange only, hence improving performance, reliability and 
                reducing maintenance efforts in the long run. It also allowed specific modifications 
                where required - e.g. the Bitfinex adapter was configured to support multi-credentials, 
                so that the service can be queried by multiple clients with different credentials. 
                The new Bitfinex service was also extended to support Spot trading along with the 
                Margin trading endpoints.
