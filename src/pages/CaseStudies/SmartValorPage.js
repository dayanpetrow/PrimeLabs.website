            The Smart Valor Platform enables investors to purchase cryptocurrencies, utility 
            and security tokens in a fully legal and compliant with the Swiss law way. The 
            platform supports two user types - Individual investors and Business investors. 
            Each user type has to comply with different legal requirements, depending on the 
            amount they were willing to invest.

                    <p>
                        One of the most important functionalities of the platform is the 
                        user onboarding with flawless KYC and AML processes. Once we created 
                        the platform concepts, workflows and designs, the team started 
                        implementation of the first iteration of the platform. 
                        KYC process guides individual users through submitting a copy of their 
                        identity documents so that they pass a compliant verification. 
                        Businesses, on the other hand, verify their company data by providing 
                        certificate of incorporation.

                    <p>
                        The FINMA Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance sets out the requirements 
                        for the professional practice of financial intermediation and the 
                        due diligence obligations and reporting duties which traders must 
                        fulfil. Individual users provide sources of income and/or wealth. 
                        Businesses provide sources of income and/wealth for their 
                        representatives and controlling employees.

                    <p>
                        The official launch of the platform was the Pre-sale phase where 
                        investors can sign up and buy VALOR tokens at discounted prices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pre-sales requests were tracked via integration with Salesforce. 
                        All investors automatically receive required legal paperwork 
                        (contracts) that can be signed online via DocuSign integration. 
                        Supported payment methods include both cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin 
                        and Ethereum) as well as conventional FIAT investment (via wire 
                        transfer). All cryptocurrency investments are tracked via 
                        privately deployed BTC and ETH nodes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The whole investment process is fully automated and will be used 
                        as a base for all further fundraising campaigns.

                        The next iteration of the platform extended payment methods with 
                        credit card integration and introduced the very important trading 
                        functionality. It enables end-users to buy and sell digital assets 
                        by submitting market and limit orders, while monitoring the order 
                        book and asset price. User wallets were enabled as well enabling 
                        deposit and withdraw of tokens.
